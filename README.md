 The code I used for Bad Apple  in Terraria using announcement boxes.
You do not need terraria but the formatting is terraria specific.


**Limitations Of Terraria**

- Resolution has to be less than 20x10
- There can only be a maximum of 1000 signs in any world(this limits bad apple to 4 frames per second)
- The messages have to be added externally with a tool such as Tedit
- As far as Iâ€™ve checked this process cannot be automated.
- I don't know the character limit but my worst case scenario still works.


**Notes**

This code is unoptimised. 
It's unclean and missing ALOT of comments but it'S so easy to understand i dont think it needs them.
